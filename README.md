# Neonode Touch Sensor Module interface library for Arduino

An Arduino library for communicating with the [Neonode Touch Sensor Module] optical touch sensor. Handles the fundamental BER encoded ASN.1 messages.

# Introduction
The library offers an easy way to communicate with the sensor as well as some primitive parsing of the ASN.1 serialized messages. This makes it easy to get x and y coordinates from touch notifications or set different settings in the sensor. The library does not have support for all messages available in the ASN.1 protocol, however the I2C read and write functions are public and can be used if any additional settings or requests need to be sent/read from the sensor.

# How to use the library

## Main Loop
The library is built around using zforce.GetMessage() as the main loop for reading messages from the sensor. GetMessage checks if the data ready pin is high and if it is, the function zforce.Read() will be called. The read function takes a buffer parameter which is used to store the data from the sensor.
```C++
Message* Zforce::GetMessage()
{
  Message* msg = nullptr;
  if(GetDataReady() == HIGH)
  {
    if(!Read(buffer))
    {
      msg = VirtualParse(buffer);
      ClearBuffer(buffer);
    }
  }
   
  return msg;
}
```
When GetMessage has been called it is up to the end user to destroy the message by calling zforce.DestroyMessage() and passing the message pointer as a parameter.

## Send and Read Messages
The library has support for some basic settings in the sensor, for example zforce.SetTouchActiveArea(). When writing a message to the sensor the end user has to make sure that data ready is not high before writing. This is done by calling GetMessage and reading whatever might be in the I2C buffer.

When a message has been sent, the sensor always creates a response that has to be read by the host. It could take some time for the sensor to create the response and put it on the I2C buffer, which is why it is recommended to call the GetMessage function in a do while loop after sending a request.
```C++
// Make sure that there is nothing in the I2C buffer before writing to the sensor
Message* msg = zforce.GetMessage();
if(msg != NULL)
{
  // Here you can read whatever is in the message or just destroy it.
  zforce.DestroyMessage(msg);
}
 
// Send the Touch Active Area request
zforce.TouchActiveArea(50,50,2000,4000);
 
// Wait for the response to arrive
do
{
  msg = zforce.GetMessage();
} while (msg == NULL);
 
// See what the response contains
if(msg->type == MessageType::TOUCHACTIVEAREATYPE)
{
  Serial.print("minX is: ");
  Serial.println(((TouchActiveAreaMessage*)msg)->minX);
  Serial.print("minY is: ");
  Serial.println(((TouchActiveAreaMessage*)msg)->minY);
  Serial.print("maxX is: ");
  Serial.println(((TouchActiveAreaMessage*)msg)->maxX);
  Serial.print("maxY is: ");
  Serial.println(((TouchActiveAreaMessage*)msg)->maxY);
}
 
zforce.DestroyMessage(msg);
```
